mcfeedback — Network Topology (experiments 001–010)
=====================================================

HIDDEN LAYERS: None (not a layered feedforward network)

Architecture: 2 recurrent clusters, probabilistically fully connected.

  Cluster 0 (input side)          Cluster 1 (output side)
  ────────────────────────        ────────────────────────
   2  modulatory neurons           2  modulatory neurons
   5  input neurons                5  output neurons
  23  regular neurons             23  regular neurons
  ──────────────────              ──────────────────
  30  total                       30  total

  Grand total: 60 neurons, ~0 synapses from/to modulatories

Connectivity (probabilistic, all-to-all within constraints):
  Intra-cluster: 60% connection probability   (cluster 0↔0, cluster 1↔1)
  Inter-cluster: 50% connection probability   (cluster 0↔1, bidirectional)
  Recurrent:     yes — no restriction on direction within or between clusters
  Self-loops:    excluded

  Expected synapse count: ~800–900 (regular neurons only)

What the "regular" neurons do:
  The 23 regular neurons in each cluster are neither input nor output.
  They sit between the input nodes and the output nodes and can relay
  signals, but they are NOT a dedicated hidden layer:
    - They are not arranged in layers
    - They receive feedback from output neurons
    - They connect back to input neurons
    - Each seed produces a different random wiring

Why this matters for our experiments:
  There is no clean input→hidden→output signal path.
  Learning must work across a tangled recurrent graph.
  The flag gate mechanism has to find useful synapses in this soup —
  which is likely why saturation is so hard to avoid: every synapse
  participates on almost every step.

Signal flow (simplified):
  Input neurons (clamped to pattern)
       ↓  (via weighted synapses, intra + inter)
  Regular neurons in both clusters (recurrent, tangled)
       ↓
  Output neurons (compared to target → reward signal)
       ↓
  Modulatory neurons fire if reward ≠ 0
       ↓
  Chemical diffuses spatially → modulates weight updates

Clusters are spaced 10 units apart along X axis.
Neurons within each cluster are scattered in ±2 unit spread (3D).
Ambient field radius: 3 units (affects intra-cluster neighbours only).
Chemical diffusion radius: 15 units (spans both clusters in Full model).
